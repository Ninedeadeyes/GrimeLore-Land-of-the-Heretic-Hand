# GrimeLore-Land-of-the-Heretic-Hand 1.11a
2D Open world ASCII rpg written in standard Library Python delivering an old school rpg experience. 


Is it the best open world rpg you have ever played ? Probably not but is it the best open world rpg you ever played coded in python 3 just using the standard library ? ( Potentially )  

A hand reaches out from a shallow grave...That hand is yours.. You gasp for air as you free yourself. The only thing you can remember is your name.
You see a wood sign pointing south east label 'Beggar's Hole'. Maybe you will find some answers there or at least a safe place to sleep

Explore the land of the Heretic Hand and unravel the mystery of your past. Craft powerful weapons from the broken bodies of your enemies. Choose between 3 Class paths ( Shadow Hunter, Holy Knight and the Doom Wizard) each with their unique play style. Test your might in the Blood Pits of Telpo, complete bounty hunts called 'Blood Contracts' to gain reputation and other delightful rewards. After all that, if you think you are 'hard' enough challenge the Doom King of the Heretic Hand and free the land of his consuming darkness. 


Note:

Most likely I will be updating the game, even though complete, it still need some polishing and there will be bugs since the only person who has done any testing is me but hopefully nothing game breaking. Will be grateful with any feedback to improve the game. I have uploaded the game engine and a method of entering command line without pressing enter in 'Misc'.
